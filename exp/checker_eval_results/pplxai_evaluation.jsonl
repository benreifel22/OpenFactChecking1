There are various reasons why this statement is untrue:\n\n1. **Lack of Confirmation Does Not Equal Falsehood**: A claim's lack of confirmation does not automatically make it false. There could be other reasons why the claim cannot be confirmed, such as insufficient data, limited resources for investigation, or the claim being too complex to be fully understood.\n\n2. **False Claims Can Be Confirmed**: Some false claims can be confirmed through independent investigation. For example, a claim that a specific medication is effective in treating a certain condition could be confirmed by a study that shows the medication's efficacy, even if the claim is ultimately found to be false due to other factors.\n\n3. **True Claims Can Be Unconfirmable**: Some true claims cannot be confirmed by independent investigation. For example, a claim that an individual has a certain personality trait based on their behavior cannot be confirmed through independent investigation, as personality traits are subjective and can vary based on the observer's perspective.\n\n4. **Independent Investigation Is Not the Only Form of Confirmation**: There are other ways to confirm the truthfulness of a claim, such as through expert opinion, historical records, or logical reasoning. These forms of confirmation may not be as definitive as independent investigation, but they can still provide evidence to support or refute a claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"If a claim cannot be confirmed by an independent investigation, then it must be false\" is untrue, as it oversimplifies the complex nature of claim verification and the role of independent investigation in determining truthfulness.","is_supported":true}

If there is a condiment or seasoning you know you'll want, it's better to ask before the meal.\n2. Saying the food is \"surprisingly\" good: This can imply that you didn't think the food would be that good or that you don't typically enjoy the food the host usually serves. It can make the person cooking feel self-conscious about their culinary skills.\n3. Leaving behind your leftovers: While this might feel generous in the moment, it can save everyone a lot of trouble if you mention it in advance.\n4. Getting \"out of the way\" and leaving before cleanup: The host might appreciate your help with cleanup, as it can be a lot of work to prepare, host, and clean up from a party.\n\nIt's generally considered polite to communicate your needs and preferences in advance, respect the host's efforts, and offer to help with cleanup if possible.","is_supported":true}

The relationship has been estimated to follow an inverse-U or an S shape, with demand for commodities initially growing rapidly at low levels of income, and then plateauing or even declining at higher income levels. Additionally, the average annual growth rate of per capita GDP in EMDEs was 3% between 1970 and 2020, and in China, it increased from less than $300 in 1970 to more than $10,000 in 2020, an average annual growth rate of 7.7%.

While parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech and perform simple tasks, recent research suggests that they may also have cognitive abilities that extend beyond vocal learning.\n\nA study by researchers at Duke University found that parrots have specialized brain regions that are activated during vocalization, which may contribute to their superior vocal learning capacities. Additionally, parrots have been shown to exhibit deductive reasoning, which is believed to be among the highest in the animal kingdom, comparable to apes and cetaceans. Some researchers claim that the cognitive abilities of parrots are equivalent to those of a three- or four-year-old human child.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all parrots have the same cognitive abilities, and African greys seem to be more advanced than many of their parrot counterparts.
