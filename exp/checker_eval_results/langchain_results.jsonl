Explanation: The Populist movement in the late 19th century can be seen as a reaction to the Second Industrial Revolution. As industrialization transformed the United States into an urban and industrial society, farmers and workers faced various economic hardships. Many farmers experienced overproduction and faced high tariffs, leading to financial struggles. Their concerns were exacerbated by the lack of government intervention. In response, farmers organized into alliances and later formed the Populist Party to advocate for their interests.

Populism refers to a political approach that seeks to appeal to the interests and emotions of ordinary people, often by advocating for policies that are popular but may not be in the best long-term interest of the country or society as a whole. Populist politicians tend to frame their message as being against an elite or establishment, and position themselves as champions of the common people. On the other hand, caring about people is a more general concept that refers to a concern for the well-being and welfare of others. This can be expressed through personal relationships, social or political activism, or in many other ways. Caring about people can be a genuine and altruistic expression of empathy and compassion, and can lead to positive changes in society.

However, there was a growing desire among American leaders, such as President Thomas Jefferson, to acquire more land in order to secure the country's future and provide space for its growing population. The Louisiana Purchase presented a unique opportunity to fulfill these ambitions. The Louisiana Territory, a vast area spanning approximately 828,000 square miles, was owned by France.

The idea of the streamlining is to decrease drag. While moving under speeds of 60 km\/h, the greatest source of energy loss is the rolling friction, and there is very little reason for streamlining. But the drag caused by the air is proportional directly to the cross section of the train and squarely to the speed, and on speeds around 90 km\/h the drag caused by the air is equal to that of the rolling friction, and on speeds of 120 km\/h and more the drag causes far more energy loss than rolling friction. Do not get me wrong. Steam locomotives are goddamn inefficient contraptions. Most steam engines have a single expansion double action work cylinder, which means their thermal efficiency is around 5% to 8% - the rest of the enthalpy of the fuel is wasted. For each kilojoule of energy put to pull the train, up to 20 kilojoules are wasted. Now with wastage of energy like this any savings on the fuel matter.

Explanation The weight of a person is the force exerted on their body due to gravity. It is directly related to the mass of the person and the acceleration due to gravity at the location where they are jumping. On different planets, the acceleration due to gravity varies. For example, the gravity on Mars is about 38% of that on Earth, while the gravity on Jupiter is about 2.5 times that on Earth. When a person jumps, they use their muscles to exert a force against the ground, propelling themselves into the air. The force they can exert is limited by their muscle strength and the mass of their body. However, the distance they can jump is also affected by the gravitational pull of the planet. On a planet with weaker gravity, such as Mars, a person can jump further because the force of gravity pulling them back down is less. Conversely, on a planet with stronger gravity, like Jupiter, a person will jump a shorter distance because the force pulling them back down is greater.

Of course, these would be about two weeks apart, since it takes half a month for the moon to go from the front to the back of the Earth (or vise versa). The reason we don't have both types of eclipse EVERY month is that the planes of the two orbits are slightly tilted from one another (about 5 degrees), so that the moon's orbit crosses the Earth's orbit only twice a year.

You got this one wrong. The description above applies to full moon. Correct is: A new moon is when the Moon is (roughly) in between Sun and Earth.

At new moon, solar eclipses can happen if Moon gets located exactly between Sun and Earth, thus blocking the view from Earth to Sun.

Based on this calculation, the next solar eclipse is estimated to occur on June 21, 2020. Question 2: Explain the Difference Between a Solar and Lunar Eclipse Describe the key differences between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse. Answer: \u3010Explanation\u3011: A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the sunlight from reaching Earth. This can only happen during a new moon phase. On the other hand, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, causing Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon. Lunar eclipses can only occur during a full moon phase. In summary, a solar eclipse involves the Moon blocking the Sun's light from reaching Earth, while a lunar eclipse involves Earth's shadow falling on the Moon. \u3010Answer\u3011: The main difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse is the positioning of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. During a solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the Sun's light from reaching Earth, occurring during a new moon phase. In contrast, during a lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, happening during a full moon phase. Question 3: Explain the Phases of the Moon Describe the different phases of the Moon and how they occur. Answer: \u3010Explanation\u3011: The Moon goes through different phases as it orbits the Earth. The phases include New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Third Quarter, and Waning Crescent. These phases are a result of the changing positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun relative to each other. The amount of sunlight reflected by the Moon determines its appearance in the sky during each phase. \u3010Answer\u3011: The phases of the Moon include New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Third Quarter, and Waning Crescent. These phases occur due to the changing positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, affecting the amount of sunlight reflected by the Moon. Question 4: Predict When a Lunar Eclipse Occurs Based on the knowledge of lunar eclipses occurring during a full moon phase, predict when the next lunar eclipse will occur. Answer: \u3010Explanation\u3011: Lunar eclipses occur during a full moon phase when the Earth is positioned between the Sun and the Moon, causing Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon. By calculating the time it takes for the Moon to move from a new moon to a full moon phase (about 14 days), we can predict when the next lunar eclipse will occur. \u3010Answer\u3011: Based on the information that lunar eclipses occur during a full moon phase, the next lunar eclipse is predicted to occur on November 30, 2020. Explanation To predict when the next solar eclipse will occur, we need to understand that solar eclipses happen during a new moon phase when the Moon is directly between the Earth and the Sun. The average frequency of solar eclipses is about 2-5 per year. The next solar eclipse can be predicted by calculating the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth (about 29.5 days) and align with the Sun. By considering this information, we can estimate when the next solar eclipse will occur.\", 'votes': 0}, {'link': 'https:\/\/brainly.com\/question\/32169709', 'source': 'Brainly', 'question': '1) If the Full Moon is setting in the west, approximately what time is it? 2) If the First Quarter Moon is setting in the West, approximately what time is it? 3) A total eclipse of the moon can only happen during which phase? 4 ) A total solar eclipse can only happen durring which phase? 5)How many days does it take the moon to orbit earth once? 6) This is called a _____ Month. 7) How many days does it take the moon to complete all its phases? 8) This is called a ______ Month. 9) Explain why question 5 and 7 are not the same number of days. 10) Explain why we dont see eclipses every month', 'answer': '1.

On April 14, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer and actor, during a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater. The following morning, Lincoln died from his injuries, leading to a period of national mourning and significant political change.

Lincoln, who had led the nation through the tumultuous Civil War, was shot by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer, at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. His death came just days after the Confederate Army's surrender at Appomattox, which effectively ended the Civil War. The nation was left leaderless at a critical time, with the task of Reconstruction looming. Vice President Andrew Johnson, a Southern Unionist, assumed the presidency. Johnson's approach to Reconstruction was lenient towards the South, which led to conflicts with the Radical Republicans in Congress who sought to protect the rights of the newly freed slaves and punish the Southern states for their rebellion. Despite the political turmoil, Union leaders and the American people rallied to continue Lincoln's work. The Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, was ratified in December 1865.

This is a good one because it helps us step away from the terrestrial sense of things. Many mountains are in ranges. The Rockies, the Andes, the Urals, and the Himalayas are good examples. This has something to do with how the Earths crust moves. Geologists call the creation of a mountain an orogeny. Orogenics is an interesting process, but some of what we know about it does not translate to the Red Planet. Why? Because Mars has limited plate tectonics. There are crust deformities, faults and Mars-quakes, but as I was taught, it\u2019s to a much smaller, regional extent than that on Earth. Still, Olympus Mons exists. It is the largest mountain in the solar system, or more accurately, the largest volcano.

This phenomenon is closely related to the concept of saturation vapor pressure and how it changes with increasing air temperature. Saturation Vapor Pressure: Saturation vapor pressure is the maximum pressure that water vapor molecules in the air can exert when the air is saturated (holding the maximum amount of water vapor at a particular temperature). In simpler terms, it's the pressure that water vapor would exert if the air were completely saturated at a given temperature. When the air becomes saturated, its relative humidity is 100%, indicating that it contains as much water vapor as it can hold at that temperature. Relationship with Temperature: The saturation vapor pressure increases with increasing air temperature.

In addition to water vapor, the air will become moister; it contains moisture due to the presence of water vapor. So when the total amount of the molecules of the water (water vapor) increase in the given amount of air, then the molecules of the dry air, will be reduced to maintain the increment level of equilibrium of the temperature and pressure.

When water vapour changes to liquid water Explanation Condensation is a process in the water cycle where water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. It is the reverse of evaporation, where liquid water is changed into a vapor. Condensation generally occurs in the atmosphere when warm air rises, cools and looses its capacity to hold water vapor. As a result, excess water vapor condenses to form liquid droplets. These droplets gather and grow in size and when they are too heavy to remain suspended in the air, they fall as precipitation.

For example, if we consider a number 19, we know that the only factors it has are 1 and 19, so 19 will be a prime number. Composite numbers are those numbers that have more than 2 factors including 1 and the number itself. So, for example, if we consider a number 9, then we know that it has a total of three factors - 1, 3 and 9. So we get that 9 is a composite number.

When you multiply two prime numbers together, you will always get a number that has more than two divisors, namely 1, the two prime numbers, and the product itself.

In the Middle Ages, there was a demand for people with a good education to become doctors, lawyers, and theologians. All three of which required specialized knowledge that couldn't necessarily be learned through, say, an apprenticeship. The universities began simply as a way to meet the demand to train them. If you look a little deeper, something more subtle was going on. We start to see formal schools being founded in the Christian parts of Western Europe as early as the late 8th century - and possibly earlier in Britain and Ireland. There were two factors behind this. One was that various kings - most notably Alfred the Great and, especially, Charlemagne - were willing to give the schools political and financial support because they needed literate, educated people to help administer their kingdoms.

Initially, they were created as \"self-help\" groups of students wishing to learn, first and foremost, the practice of law that was becoming more and more important to urban life. For this purpose, they banded together to pay teachers. (You can find detailed accounts of this in the Wikipedia page or the answers to this question on History.SE). This quickly included also canon law, which brought increasingly many theologians to teach at universities (who, as Stephan Kolassa points out in his comment, did make many significant contributions to the knowledge of the time).

I doubt pulling someone over as a civilian is legal, strictly speaking, especially since the guy had to speed himself to keep up with the speeding officer. I know there are some situations where officers speed within their right, even without emergency lights, under certain circumstances. But I was interested, for technicality sake, in learning what legal rights civilians have if they wish to take action against an officer they believe to be needlessly violating traffic laws for personal benefit. Lets say someone witnesses an officer turn on their lights and speed to pass traffic, then sees them pull into a doughnut shop a few blocks later and want to report that kind of misuse of power. I know one can \"make a complaint\" but I\\'m wondering if there\\'s generally any legal obligation for these complaints to be taken seriously, and if there\\'s any feasible way a driver could validate the encounter. If a civilian takes a video of the officer speeding he\\'d probably be admitting to distracted driving, a crime in itself. If he looks at an ID number on the car and claims that was the car, it seems like it would be the civilian\\'s word against the officer\\'s. Wouldn\\'t that just go the officer\\'s way? Legally speaking, do civilians have any right to apprehend an officer for a traffic violation? I\\'ve heard of civilian arrest but I know little about it. I\\'m curious to know if what this civilian in the video did (asked the officer to slow down) is even legal if he managed to stop the officer without speeding to do so. Furthermore, even with evidence, is there any way a citizen could ensure that legal action be taken against the officer for a proven traffic violation?

Furthermore, even with evidence, is there any way a citizen could ensure that legal action be taken against the officer for a proven traffic violation? Beyond reporting it to the department and hoping for the best? A prosecutor is under no legal obligation to press charges (and police have no affirmative duty to enforce the laws on the books) ever, even if there is blatant and clear evidence of murder, let alone a traffic violation. Usually, there is absolutely no way to compel charges to be brought against the offender (with a handful of states providing an exception where one can seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute if the circumstances warrant that would never be invoked for a mere traffic offense). Very few states allow anyone other\u2026', 'votes': 9}, {'link': 'https:\/\/law.stackexchange.com\/questions\/36549\/if-police-collected-evidence-based-off-of-a-call-they-suspected-but-couldnt-pr', 'source': 'Law Stack Exchange', 'question': \"I'm asking this hypothetical situation mostly as I was considering writing a story with the premise and want the story to be legally accurate, but also because I'm frankly curious how the law would handle such a situation. Let's say someone (call him Bob) got sick of police being unable to act against individuals everyone 'knows' to be committing a crime due to lack of sufficient evidence to get a warrant. One day he decides to take matters into his own hands and he calls into 911 with a made up claim that he witnessed a crime take place and a gunman drag someone into a known crack house. As I understand it when the police arrive they will have sufficient justification to enter the crack house without a warrant to intervene with a crime believed to be in progress. They won't find evidence of the original, made up, crime, but once they have entered the house they will likely see evidence of other crimes. Since they were there in good faith the evidence of other crimes within 'plain sight' in the house would be fair game and could be used to make arrests and\/or get a warrant to search the rest of the house for more evidence. Despite the fraudulent nature of the original claim arrests could be made since Bob was not an agent of the police. So far this is covering legal concepts I think I understand. Now lets say that the police were never able to trace the original fraudulent call to Bob, and Bob gets it in his head to act as a the world's least interesting vigilante. He starts regularly making fraudulent calls claiming to witness a crime in progress to the police to give them justification to enter locations that are commonly believed to have illegal activity within them in a hopes of helping the police to collect enough evidence to make arrests. While Bob changes the number he is calling from and as much of his MO as he can each time the police would noticed a pattern of fraudulent claims and have reached the point that they can usually guess when a call is a fraudulent one made by Bob, but they can never be certain it's him or that a crime isn't actually happen. Assume the police have actively stated they do not support or condone Bob's actions, have made a public plea for him to stop, and are trying (but failing) to find and arrest Bob as well. I assume the police would continue to respond to the claims in case the call is real and a crime is actively in progress. Is there a point where they would no longer possess sufficient cause to enter a premise to investigate a believed crime in progress due to their suspicion the crime may not be legitimate? If they do have justification to continue to enter the premises then at what point, if ever, would evidence witnessed as a result of responding to the potentially fraudulent calls not be admissible?\", 'answer': \"Calls to 911 are treated as genuine at all times until the complaint is dealt with. This is because most people only call 911 for legitimate reasons and even some criminals call 911 because they want them to know the situation (Bomb scares are an extreme version of this as they cause a lot of disruption; they cannot be ignored because if the cops were to call bullshit and it was proven not to be bullshit, it's gonna be a lot worse than if they treat it as real and find out it's an alarm clock.). From the point of view of the first responders, whether cops, fire, or EMS, the call is always real and to be treated as such. Entering without warrant is legit if they have a probable cause of a crime or a person in distress, such as a hostage or a person in medical need; the emergency call is almost certainly sufficient.

This question and its answers are locked because the question is off-topic but has historical significance. It is not currently accepting new answers or interactions. A lot of blogs and advice on the web seem to suggest that in order to become a great developer, doing just your day job is not enough. For example, you should contribute to open source projects in your spare time, write smartphone apps, etc. In fact a lot of this advice seems to suggest that if you don't love programming enough to do it all day long then you're probably in the wrong career. That doesn't ring true with me. I enjoy my work, but when I come home from the office I'm not in the mood to jump straight back onto the computer and start coding away until bedtime. I only have a certain number of hours free time each day, and I'd rather spend them on other hobbies, seeing friends or going outside than in front of the computer. I do get a kick out of programming, and do hack around outside of work occasionally. I'm committed to my personal development and spend time reading tech blogs and books as a way to keep learning and becoming better. But that doesn't extend so far as to my wanting to use all my spare time for coding. Does this mean I'm not a 'true' software developer at heart?

It's logarithmic: The only reason that a musician might practice longer than 3 hours, is that they need to squeeze out the extra 1% that those hours gives them. If you think that applies to you, re-solving a problem CS solved 2 decades ago, then you have a prima-donna complex to boot.

An organism that is multicellular, has cellulose in its cell walls, and is capable of photosynthesis is typical of the Kingdom Plantae. These characteristics are defining traits of plants, which are eukaryotic organisms that prepare their own food by converting light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. They are autotrophic, which means they do not require external sources of organic carbon because they produce their own by using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.In contrast, the Kingdom Fungi consists of organisms that have cell walls but do not perform photosynthesis and obtain nutrition through absorption.

Tip: When identifying the kingdom of a particular organism, it's important to consider the key characteristics such as the ability to produce food through photosynthesis, the presence or absence of specialized tissues, and the composition of the cell walls. Description: This question required us to identify an organism's kingdom by focusing on certain specific features such as photosynthesis capability, cell structure, and nutritional habits. The given class of organisms, Chlorophyceae, exhibit traits that are known to be common in the Protista kingdom, including diverse nutritional habits (both autotrophic and heterotrophic) and the lack of specialized tissues.

It also mentions that the organism makes its own glucose from sunlight and has a cell wall made of cellulose. These characteristics are indicative of plants. 1. Photosynthetic: The ability to convert sunlight into energy through the process of photosynthesis is a defining feature of plants. 2. Multicellular: Being composed of many cells is another characteristic of plants, distinguishing them from unicellular organisms like bacteria and some algae. 3. Makes its own glucose from sunlight: This is a direct reference to photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. 4.

You add up all these tiny changes to get the total change f(b)\u2212f(a). In more detail, chop up the interval [a,b] into tiny pieces: a=x0<x1<\u22ef<xN=b. Note that the total change in the value of f across the interval [a,b] is the sum of the changes in the value of f across all the tiny subintervals [xi,xi+1]: f(b)\u2212f(a)=N\u22121\u2211i=0f(xi+1)\u2212f(xi).

The causes of the Second Industrial Revolution in Western Europe included an increase in natural resources, advancements in technology, and a growing labor force due to immigration. The effects were rapid economic growth, the rise of big businesses, and social changes with the emergence of a working class. 4. Socialism was a response to industrialization as it aimed to address the inequalities and challenges brought about by the rapid growth of industries. It advocated for collective or governmental ownership of the means of production. 5. Trade unions faced obstacles such as employer retaliation, legal challenges, and a lack of unity among different unions in their effort to improve labor conditions. Explanation 3. The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, was a period of rapid industrialization in Western Europe from the late 19th to early 20th century. The causes of this revolution were multifaceted. Firstly, there was a significant increase in the availability of natural resources, such as coal and iron, which were essential for powering factories and producing goods. Secondly, advancements in technology, especially in transportation and communication, facilitated the growth of industries. The development of the railway system, for instance, allowed for the efficient movement of goods and people. Additionally, there was an influx of immigrants to Western Europe, providing a large labor force for factories. The effects of the Second Industrial Revolution were profound. Economies grew at an unprecedented rate, leading to the rise of big businesses and monopolies. There was also a shift in the social structure, with a growing middle class and the emergence of a working class living in urban areas. However, this rapid industrialization also led to environmental degradation and social issues such as poor working conditions in factories. 4. Socialism emerged as a response to the challenges and inequalities brought about by industrialization. As industries grew and wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, many people, especially those in the working class, found themselves in dire economic situations. They faced long working hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. Socialism, as a political and economic theory, advocated for the collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production. It sought to address these inequalities by ensuring that the benefits of industrialization were distributed more evenly among the population. 5. Trade unions played a crucial role in the early 20th century as they sought to improve labor conditions in the face of rapid industrialization. However, they faced numerous obstacles. Employers often viewed trade unions as a threat to their profits and could retaliate by firing union members or even shutting down their factories. There were also legal challenges, with some governments viewing strikes and other union activities as illegal. Additionally, the lack of a united front among different trade unions made it difficult for them to collectively bargain with employers. Despite these challenges, trade unions persisted in their efforts, leading to significant improvements in labor conditions over time.', 'votes': 244}, {'link': 'https:\/\/www.studystack.com\/flashcard-4087942', 'source': 'Study Stack', 'question': 'What did governmental, political, and social organization all struggle to address', 'answer': 'effects of large-scale industrialization, economic uncertainty, and related social changes such as urbanization and mass migration.', 'votes': 0}, {'link': 'https:\/\/www.questionai.com\/questions-tQtrlC8rkC\/industrialization-amp-rise-big-business-identify', 'source': 'QuestionAI', 'question': 'Industrialization & Rise of Big Business: Identify the following and explain their link to Industrialization and rise of big business. laissez-faire capitalism - Investment capital- social Darwinism Bessemer process electricity', 'answer': 'Laissez-faire capitalism fueled industrialization by encouraging entrepreneurs to establish businesses and earn profits. 2. Investment capital: \u3010Explanation\u3011: Investment capital refers to the funds that are used to start or expand a business. During the period of industrialization, there was a significant increase in investment capital as investors sought to capitalize on the opportunities presented by new industries. The availability of investment capital allowed for the expansion of factories, the purchase of machinery, and the hiring of workers, all of which were essential for the growth of big businesses. \u3010Answer\u3011: Investment capital was crucial for the expansion of factories, purchase of machinery, and hiring of workers during industrialization. 3. Social Darwinism: \u3010Explanation\u3011: Social Darwinism is a theory that applies the concept of natural selection to human society. It suggests that in the business world, the strongest and fittest businesses survive, while weaker ones perish. This belief was used to justify the success of big businesses and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. It provided a moral and ideological framework for the rise of big business, as it was seen as a natural and inevitable outcome of competition in a free market. \u3010Answer\u3011: Social Darwinism justified the success of big businesses and the concentration of wealth and power during the rise of big business. 4. Bessemer process: \u3010Explanation\u3011: The Bessemer process was a method for mass-producing steel by blowing air through molten pig iron to remove impurities. This process revolutionized the steel industry by making steel production more efficient and cost-effective. The availability of cheap and abundant steel enabled the construction of railroads, bridges, and buildings, which facilitated the expansion of industries and the growth of big businesses. \u3010Answer\u3011: The Bessemer process revolutionized steel production, enabling the construction of railroads, bridges, and buildings, and supporting the growth of big businesses. 5. Electricity: \u3010Explanation\u3011: The discovery and utilization of electricity were pivotal in the industrialization process. Electricity allowed for the operation of machines and equipment in factories, leading to increased productivity and efficiency. It also enabled the development of new technologies and products, such as the light bulb, which improved working conditions and extended the workday. The widespread use of electricity was instrumental in the rise of big business, as it allowed for the expansion of markets and the growth of industries. \u3010Answer\u3011: Electricity enabled the operation of machines and equipment in factories, increased productivity, and supported the growth of big businesses. Explanation Laissez-faire capitalism is an economic philosophy that advocates for minimal government intervention in the economy. This approach allows for the free market to regulate itself through supply and demand. In the context of industrialization and the rise of big business, laissez-faire capitalism played a significant role by encouraging entrepreneurs to establish businesses and earn profits.

During the Civil War, the government printed lots of paper money called \"greenbacks.\" This surplus money led to inflation so the government withdrew paper money and returned to the gold standard. As a result, the U.S. experienced deflation which lowered prices but lowered prices meant farmers might be unable to repay debts and face financial ruin. These problems convinced farmers to organize into groups like the Grangers and the Farmers\\' Alliance but both groups failed to improve farmers\\' lives.
