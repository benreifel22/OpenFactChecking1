Here:
1. 'claims_info' contains all the collected evidence and related stances data
2. Per claim - 'prior_label' indicates claim verdict (false or true), copied from Factbench.jsonl entry for the same claim, while 'label' indicates the factool_claim_examiner verdict. 'label' could take four values - 0 is false, 1 is true, 2 is mixed (partially false, but also somewhat true) and -1 is unable to detect.
